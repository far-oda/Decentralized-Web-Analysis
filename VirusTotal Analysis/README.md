## Virustotal Analysis

In this folder we have the results of running analysis on 8 samples, 4 Linux samples each of them for a different Linux architecture (amd64, arm7, arm64, and 386), and 4 windows samples that are all Win PE 32bit however each of them is different.

Due to the nature of windows malware there are more sandbox environments for windows which is why I added a folder for each windows sample and it contains all the results for each sandbox

Sandboxes:

For linux: Zenbox

For windows: CAPE Sandbox, Dr.Web vxCube, VirusTotal Jujubox, and Zenbox
